This repository contains a set of scripts to automate the process of
gathering data from malware samples, training a machine learning model
on that data, and plotting its classification accuracy.

0. Make a copy of config-template.ini called config.ini and edit it.

1. Ensure that the "tools" subdirectory has been initialized ("`$ git submodule update --init tools`")

2. Either use `get_samples.py` to download samples or copy them into "all_apks" from another source.

3. `sort_malicious.py` uses andrototal.org to sort them into "malicious_apk" and "benign_apk" folders.

4. `extract_apks.sh` unpacks the .apk files into folders and checks the AndroidManifest.xml files for validity.

5. `parse_xml.py` reads the AndroidManifest.xml files and puts the permissions requested by each app into "app_permission_vectors.json".

6. `run_trials.sh` runs the `tensorflow_learn.py` script (where the ML happens) a number of times and writes the results to "results.csv".

7. `plot_data.py` plots the data produced by the previous step using matplotlib.
