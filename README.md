This repository contains a set of scripts to automate the process of
gathering data from malware samples, training a machine learning model
on that data, and plotting its classification accuracy.
0. The malware samples should be in a folder titled "all_apks".
1. `sort_malicious.py` uses andrototal.org to sort them into "malicious_apk" and "benign_apk" folders.
2. `extract_apks.sh` unpacks the .apk files into folders and checks the AndroidManifest.xml files for validity.
3. `parse_xml.py` reads the AndroidManifest.xml files and puts the permissions requested by each app into "app_permission_vectors.json".
4. `run_trials.sh` runs the `tensorflow_learn.py` script (where the ML happens) a number of times and writes the results to "results.csv".
5. `plot_data.py` plots the data produced by the previous step using matplotlib.
